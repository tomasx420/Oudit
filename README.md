![The database diagram](docs/db.png)
Notes: This is the first version of the db - a lot of places for improvements and changes! (e.g. Status can be an entity...); The timestamps are also left from the diagram

### The seeded data
When `php artisan db:seed` is executed the data that is being filled in the database is the following:
* A user with credentials: `email: john.doe@hz.nl; password: asd123`
* A type of audit - 5S
* All 28 questions relevant to the 5S audit + 'additional comments' question

| Number | User story                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| 1      | As an auditor I want to be able to view all on-going audits relevant to me (corresponding to my level and department) on the audit dashboard page (so that I have up-to-date information about the audits in progress). |
| 2      | As an auditor I want to be able to create a new on-going audit corresponding to my level and department (so that it is displayed in the audit dashboard).                                                               |
| 3      | As an auditor I want to be able to update an on-going auditâ€™s attributes that is within my level and department (so that I can fill the data that has been gathered from the audit).                                    |
| 4      | As an auditor I want to be able to log in the system (so that I access all functionalities that are relevant to me in the app)                                                                                          |
